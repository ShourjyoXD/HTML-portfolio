<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in backend and frontend technologies.
   I specialize in building dynamic, responsive, and user-centric web applications that solve real-world problems. 
   With a keen eye for clean design and a structured mindset for scalable architecture, I aim to create digital experiences that are both beautiful and powerful.</p>

<p>My core expertise lies in crafting full-stack solutions using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks such as Node.js or Python (Flask/Django).
   I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant code — from building RESTful APIs to integrating databases and deploying secure, high-performance applications. 
   I follow best practices in version control, testing, and documentation to ensure my projects are reliable and maintainable.</p>

<p>For me, web development is more than just writing code — it’s about creating impact. 
  I love how even a simple feature can improve someone’s experience, automate tasks, or make information more accessible. 
  I'm constantly learning and evolving, exploring new frameworks and trends to stay ahead in this ever-changing field.
   Whether it’s collaborating on a team project or hacking away on a personal idea, I’m driven by the joy of building things that matter.</p>
